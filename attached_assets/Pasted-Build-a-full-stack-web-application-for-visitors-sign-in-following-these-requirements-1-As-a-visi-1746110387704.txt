Build a full stack web application for visitors sign-in. following these requirements:
1.	As a visitor I need to easily open on my mobile the sign-in page, where I will entre my first and last name, address and phone number. After entering this information, I should be able to click a button and save the information and then I’m done.

The page should be fast and intuitive, following these technical requirements:
1.	Use Next.js
2.	PostgresQL for storage
3.	Microservices architecture, building microservices in AWS-Lambdas
4.	Use javascript to write the AWS-lambdas 
5.	Use AuroraDB for Postgresql for storage
6.	Use terraform scripts to create the AWS infrastructure
Pages-UI:
1.	Sign in page
a.	This page displays a header with the branding of the event host. The labels and fields should be intuitive and easy to use
b.	The visitor registration fields
i.	First and last name. Required fields

3.	Host-Admin login page
a.	On this page the user needs to login using username and password
b.	Upon login, the user has the options to:

a.	Validates the required parameters: First name, Last name
b.	Pulls current event using GET-event microservice, which returns event-id
c.	Validates that this visitor is not registered before on the same event

b.	End date and time, 4 hours from start date and time by default
c.	Event-id, uuid autogenerated
d.	Status: enabled by default and disabled when the end date and time become current
4.	Disable-event: this microservice changes the event status to disabled
a.	Input: event-id
b.	Returns: success or error if the event-id is invalid/ does not exist
Write every single file and script needed to build every part of this application following the requirements and specifications mentioned above.  Additionally write the steps to run and deploy the application and the file structure. Make it robust and Production ready.
